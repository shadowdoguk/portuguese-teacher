# Progress Tracker

A living document. Read this at the start of every session to pick up where the last one left off. Update it whenever an issue transitions state, a branch lands, a decision is made, or a blocker appears or clears.

**Last updated:** 2026-06-23

## Current focus

**#2 — Curriculum data model + seed A0 content (pt-PT only)** *(next up; not yet started)*

- **Branch:** `feat/issue-2-curriculum-model` (not yet created)
- **Scope:** minimum-viable slice — TypeScript types, in-memory curriculum graph, `resolveAnchors()` runtime, A0 fixture Units, graph-reachability + anchor-acyclicity tests. Skip Prisma/DB and full A0 seed content (file as follow-up issues).
- **Unblocks:** #4, #5, #7, #8, #15, #17.
- **Independent of:** PR #20 review (proceed in parallel; no dep).

## Issue status

### Closed

- **#1** Bootstrap Next.js + TypeScript app shell

### Open — implementation queue (dep-ordered)

- **#2** Curriculum data model + seed A0 content (pt-PT only) — **next**
- **#4** HLR Spaced Repetition scheduler + review queue
- **#5** Voice Loop (Tier 1/2/3) end-to-end
- **#6** LLM difficulty control pipeline (generate → re-rank)
- **#7** Conversational Practice UI + scenario library (≥ 30 scenarios)
- **#8** Proficiency assessments + Milestone gating
- **#9** Learner profile, dashboard, progress, settings UI
- **#13** ASR accuracy regression test suite

### Open — non-functional (NFR)

- **#10** Accessibility (WCAG 2.2 AA) audit and fixes
- **#11** Performance budgets + Lighthouse CI
- **#12** Observability + graceful degradation
- **#14** Cross-device compatibility smoke tests

### Open — new from ADR-0003

- **#15** Placement Lesson at sign-up (above-A0 self-assessment) — depends on #2
- **#16** SC-5 Sampling Buffer infra (production WER sampling) — depends on #5, #13
- **#17** Remedial Anchor routing (curriculum runtime, no DAG back-edges) — depends on #2, #18
- **#18** Affective Filter proxy instrumentation — no strong deps
- **#19** Pronunciation Score phoneme-distance endpoint — depends on #3, #5

## PRs

- **#20** MiniMax AI client wrappers (LLM/ASR/TTS) — open, awaiting human review. Merge does not block #2.

## Decisions log

- **2026-06-23 — ADR-0003 v1 scope amendment.** v1 is **pt-PT only** (pt-BR deferred to v1.1). v1 ladder is **five stages** (A0 → A1 → A2 → B1) with **three Milestones** at level boundaries. Remediation is via **Remedial Anchors** (pointers, not back-edges in the DAG). Above-A0 self-assessments route through a **Placement Lesson**. Production WER sampling uses a separate **SC-5 Sampling Buffer** (ephemeral, opt-in-agnostic). **OAuth sign-in** deferred to v1.1. See `docs/adr/0003-v1-scope-amendment.md`.
- **2026-06-23 — AGENTS.md consolidation.** Three `docs/agents/*.md` files (issue-tracker, triage-labels, domain) folded into `AGENTS.md`.
- **2026-06-23 — MiniMax wrapper contract.** All three wrappers emit a structured latency log (`{type:'minimax_latency', endpoint, durationMs, ok}`) and the contract-smoke test runs them against a local `node:http` server, providing CI coverage until real creds land.

## Blockers

- **§10 sign-off on ADR-0003 + amended requirements doc** — Product, Pedagogy, Engineering leads. Work proceeds in parallel since the spec is captured in code; this gates release, not development.

## Conventions reminder

- Use the glossary in [`CONTEXT.md`](./CONTEXT.md) — do not invent synonyms
- The 5-state triage vocabulary (`needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, `wontfix`) + 2 categories (`bug`, `enhancement`) apply to every issue
- One logical unit per commit; messages match repo style (`feat(scope): ...`, `docs+code: ...`)
- New domain terms → `CONTEXT.md` in the same change
- New architectural decisions → `docs/adr/<NNNN>-<slug>.md`
- `pnpm typecheck` / `pnpm lint` / `pnpm test` / `pnpm build` must pass before commit
- Work happens on a feature branch named `feat/issue-<N>-<slug>`; main is for merged work

## Update discipline

Update this file when:

- An issue moves into or out of **In progress** / **Next** / **Recently completed**
- A new issue is filed
- A decision is captured (add a line to **Decisions log**)
- A blocker appears or clears
- The **Current focus** changes
- **Bump `**Last updated:**` to today's date on every change** — the drift check uses it.

## Drift check

`pnpm progress:check` (a small Node script at `scripts/progress-check.mjs`) compares PROGRESS.md against the live issue tracker and fails if:

- Any open issue is missing from PROGRESS.md's queue
- `**Last updated:**` is more than 14 days old

It runs in CI on every push to `main` and every PR. If you change the issue tracker without updating PROGRESS.md (or vice versa), CI will fail — fix one or the other.

To run locally: `pnpm progress:check` (needs `gh auth login` first). Override the staleness threshold with `PROGRESS_STALE_AFTER_DAYS=N`.
